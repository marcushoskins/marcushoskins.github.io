This is my personal website. It contains, among other things: work I've published, thoughts I'd like to return to, papers/books I'd like to read, and links to interesting things.

For info on how to edit things here, see [this guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
