This is where we will put advice for giving talks.

See <a href="https://mcgreevy.physics.ucsd.edu/advice.html" target="_blank">here</a> for John McGreevy's advice on giving talks and doing research. The references therein are very illuminating. As he says, "the main lesson...is about having mercy on the audience". His own advice is also spectacular.

See Robert Geroch's detailed approach <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9703019" target="_blank">here</a> for a step-by-step guide to structure talks.

See Mermin's impassioned essay <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay141/mermin.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for why many talks today should not be the status quo.

See Halmos's essay <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b572/public/HalmosHowToTalk.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> when thinking about how to use mathematics in talks. 

See Schwartz's thoughts <a href="https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/cob/content_public/journal/jcs/121/11/10.1242_jcs.033340/3/1771.pdf?Expires=1757509953&Signature=XHBVnp50apcRA6sKFOlDc4l-Ma8gOl98~RDLBWV9IWuu02tefxbTJzuxyGKNLuLmSm0MF7IHhpvRAtlD3hy2xqX1emXULieTzwIHyiM8VdcCEsuANg7I~ouPmkwIH3IueG-krzAVN27V3gmIYcVkJ1DJshCFiANYYtmzQTyCqOVsnKv8PecJK8NFv8t-RwTIrEEtVYQctrb~ER~DVzMk3LBDTnrn9e1wXQyAj0R6zBKCVmk-DGK6Ngv~GrQPUz-KVYftlwHODW9vUlT1DDD~rbxpJB3V6Wsp0Be8T6czAL1k477gmnqJZSEwjhw2UjXMqhEgXBe5zTprV5zeudBnow__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" target="_blank">here</a> to understand the important of stupidity in scientific research. 

See John Baez's advice to young scientists <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/advice.html" target="_blank">here</a>. One should particularly see this advice if he cares about keeping his soul while in academia. He also has some very nice advice on giving talks. 

See Rota's advice on teaching <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
